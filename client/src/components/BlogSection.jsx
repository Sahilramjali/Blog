                Unearthing the Girls of the Holocaust: Girlhood at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum

            <p className="description">
                Over the course of my Spring Break back in March of 2023, I had the opportunity with the support of the McGrath Global Research Grant provided by Katie McGrath, the JJ Abrams Family Foundation, and the Provost’s Office at Simmons University to travel to Washington D.C. and to spend several days exploring the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, arguably one of the the primary learning centers in the United States about the Holocaust.

                The aim of this exploration was two-fold. First, I scoured the museum displays regarding any information related to girl’s experiences during the Holocaust. Due to extensive funding, the majority of the archives associated with this museum have been digitized and are available online. I worked deeply with these archival materials (in particular, written and oral histories) to uncover examples of girlhood during the Holocaust. While at the museum itself, I took careful note of the displays and information that I had not uncovered through my own research that I or other researchers could further expand upon and use to supplement the exhibition currently being developed by the Girl Museum.
